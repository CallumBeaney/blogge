> ## 我将称之日历史意见。历史意见，指的是在那制度实施时代的人们所切身感受而发出的意见。这些意见，比较真实而客观。待时代隔得久了，该项制度早已消失不存在，而后代人单凭后代人自己所处的环境和需要来批评历史上以往的各项制度，那只能说是一种时代意见。时代意见并非是全不合真理，但我们不该单凭时代意见来抹杀以往的历史意见。
> ## ... I call these historical views, meaning the views of those who personally experienced the implementation of the regulation under discussion. They are more truthful and objective. When later generations, in their own temporal environment and for their own needs, critique regulations that disappeared long time ago their views can only represent their own time. Their opinions may not be necessarily untruthful, yet we should not rely on them to refute historical views.
