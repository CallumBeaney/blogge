The name draw my eye; upon reading, I thought it worth a try.  
It appears in my copy of Samuel Pegge's transcription of The Forme of Cury (c. 1390). Pegge footnotes the moniker is disyllabic; `Rap-pea`:

> Rape. XX.IIII. III. Take half fyges and half raisouns pike hem and waisshe hem in water skalde hem in wyne. bray hem in a morter, and drawe hem thurgh a straynour. cast hem in a pot and þerwiþ powdour of peper and ooþer good powdours. alay it up with flour of Rys. and colour it with saundres. salt it. & messe it forth.

*Boil in wine equal quantities figs and raisins washed, stemmed, and sliced. Mash in a mortar and strain. Heat in a pot. Add spices inc. powdered pepper. Thicken with rice flour. Colour with sandalwood. Salt and serve.*

Not an historian nor a canny chef I feebled around in my first few attempts; when told to draw 'hem' through a strainer initially I thought to preserve the fruits and not their juice, reducing the amount of liquid in the pulp then padding with rice flour. The result was a sticky, thick fruitcake much like a Christmas pudding, highly rich in flavour and heavy of texture, punctuated well by the light crunch of the fig seeds unpulped. Best served this was with something like double cream or almond milk.

Consulting variations on this recipe it makes more sense that the pulp and juices of these fruits was the primary interest; they coloured the result with the red of sandalwood for that the rice flour would pale the rich night-blood red of the fruits' juices. This then was I presume heated well till thickened like a porridge.  

I recommend both.
