title="Using unsafe programming tools"

This is here for me to link to/copypaste whenever this discussion comes up; it is not a complex debate and I am bored of repeating myself in lesser words:

------

1. _Any behaviours or outcomes that a tool or toolset allows by design to occur, will at some point occur._

2. _Software engineers should be as rigorous as possible._  

3. _Even software engineers with decades of experience make simple errors in production code._  

4. _Expecting software engineers to possess a level of fallibility that does not consistently exist in the real world is not an expectation formed through non-emotional decision-making._  

5. _Regardless of what confounding circumstances lead to the decision to use an unsafe tool when safer alternatives are available, that decision to use such a tool is a decision to enable & accept the consequences of the undesired behaviours or outcomes that tool enables by design._  

6. _Unless truly necessary, using the most secure tools possible in every non-trivial scenario is the most prudent, professional decision._  

7. _This is inclusive of both memory safety and undefined behaviour._
