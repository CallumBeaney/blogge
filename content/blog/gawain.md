Below is one of my favourite parts of the Pearl Poet's *Gawain and the Green Knight*, a 14th-century poem written in a Cheshire dialect:   
  
```
After Crystenmasse com þe crabbed lentoun,
Þat fraystez flesch wyth þe fysche and fode more symple;
Bot þenne þe weder of þe worlde wyth wynter hit þrepez,
Colde clengez adoun, cloudez vplyften,
Schyre schedez þe rayn in schowrez ful warme,
Fallez vpon fayre flat, flowrez þere schewen,
Boþe groundez and þe greuez grene ar her wedez,
Bryddez busken to bylde, and bremlych syngen
For solace of þe softe somer þat sues þerafter
bi bonk;
And blossumez bolne to blowe
Bi rawez rych and ronk,
Þen notez noble innoȝe
Ar herde in wod so wlonk.  
```

##### Pronunciation:
- 'ȝ' is 'gh' as in 'enough'
- 'þ' is 'th' as in 'the'
- 'y' is pronounced like 'i' in 'with'.  

<!--  
##### Some notes here:
- __fraystez__ or 'fraist' is a test of strength or resolve, often in a form of physical attack. 
- __busken__ is like 'hasten' or 'busy oneself'.
- __bolne__ means 'swell' in much the same slightly medical manner we might now mean.
- __wlonk__ means "noble" in the sense of class or quality of behaviour, sometimes used to refer to the quality of a season or natural feature or location. 
  - The 15th century *Awntyrs off Arthure* contains the line "*To þe wode are thay wente, the wlonkeste in wedys, Bothe the kynge and the qwene.*" -- "the king and queen went to the woods in their finest clothes". Note 'wedez' (clothing) appears above also.    -->

### Here's some basic modernisation:

>*After Crystenmasse came the lonely lent season,     
Which tests the flesh with fish and food more simple;        
But then the weather of the world fights with winter,  
Cold clings down, clouds lift up,      
Brightly falls the rain in warmest showers,  
Falling upon fair fields, flowers there showing,  
Both the ground and the groves being green of clothes,  
Birds hasten to nest, and sing beautifully
For solace of the soft summer that follows thereafter  
by hillsides;  
And blossoms swell to blow  
By hedgerows rich and thick,  
And then glorious notes  
Are heard in woods so noble.*
  

The simplified version is easier to grasp for a _modern_ reader, but the economy of language, rhythm, and feeling of these words in the mouth & ears is absent. The Pearl Poet was attentive to these qualities to such a degree that a synonym of a given word will regularly appear in the selfsame line. The result is a maturity of composition making other great poems of the era such as *The Castle of Perseverance* sound almost amateur by comparison.

This kind of marginalia is unsuitable for screens. My whimsical side has a little parasocial friendship with Mr. David Woodward of St John's College, who, in addition to plentiful dictionary annotations, made little drawings of a pipe-smoking moon in my copy of _Gawain_. Whenever I struggle with a page, I feel as though I have a friend reading along with me.

### Tolkien's modernisation:

Tolkien understood the Pearl Poet well; his translation is semantically faithful, and the glossary & notes to the original with E.V. Gordon and Norman Davis are superlative in quality. His modernisation by necessity forces poetic English of the 1900s into the structure and logic of that of the 1300s:

```
after Christmas there came the crabbed Lenten
that with fish tries the flesh and with food more meager;
but then the weather in the world makes war on the winter,
cold creeps into the earth, clouds are uplifted, 
shining rain is shed in showers that all warm
fall on the fair turf, flowers there open,
of grounds and of groves green is the raiment,
birds are busy a-building and bravely are singing
for the sweetness of the soft summer that will soon be on 510
the way;
and blossoms burgeon and blow
in hedgerows bright and gay;
then glorious musics go
through the woods in proud array.
```

Tolkien is attentive to the original's language and word order. The rhythm and alliterative stresses differ significantly, particularly the 2nd line and also in the more contemporary, inappropriately sing-song '_birds are busy_ ***a-building*** _and bravely are singing_'.  

Modern English relies heavily word order; Middle English did not; many of these sentences' stresses are shifted by stricter modern grammatical patterns obliging being-verbs to appear in specific places.  

- *Bot þenne þe weder of þe worlde wyth wynter hit þrepez*       
- *But then the weather in the world makes war on the winter*

The original's 3rd line mixes 'th' and 'w' such that it alliterates on both across the line, using **w**y**th** to tie the two together after a bracketing beginning and ending full of 't' sounds (boT Thenne ; hiT Threpez).  

- *Boþe groundez and þe greuez grene ar her wedez*
- *Of grounds and of groves green is the raiment*
  
The original is bolstered with the plural form's 'ez' to further give the sentence consistency, to tie better __wedez__ with __grevez__. _Greves_ rhymes with _wedez_ and _raiment_ does not with _groves_. Line #5 ends with a 'w' in 'warme' and #7 with 'wedez'; lines #6 and #8 sibilant with 'schewen' & 'syngen'. Tolkien cannot manage such subtlties while balancing aspects.  

In these two examples I am purposefully terse; summarising in short: these insufficiencies originate not from Tolkien but his task.

### Simon Armitage's modernisation:
Armitage borrowed Tolkien's heavily, but changed words and phrases too obscure. Armitage focuses on the feeling & telling of the story, rather than on semantic faithfulness:

```
after Christmas there came the sullen Lent
that tests the flesh with fish and food more meager;
but then the weather in the world makes war on the winter, 
cold creeps back into the earth, clouds are uplifted, 
shining rain is shed in showers that warm 
and fall on the fair fields, where flowers open;
on grounds and on groves, the earth's clothing is green, 
birds are busy building and boldly are singing 
for the sweetness of the soft summer that will soon be on  
the way;
and blossoms shimmer and show 
in bushes bright as day;
their colors like melodies flow
through woods in grand display.
```

What I want to emphasise is that it was not only the story itself that made the Pearl Poet significant when re-discovered in the 19th century; it was the technical proficiency with which it was written using the language of the time.   

'Bolne' means 'swell', emphasising something gradually growing from within and usually used to reference things like pride, pus-filled boils and sexual excitement.  
  
The original was _blossumez bolne to blowe_. Tolkien chooses "_blossoms burgeon and blow_". Burgeon is semantically closer, having also archaic meaning of "to bud" and a modern meaning of expanding rapidly (often regarding industry or business), but "burgeon" and "bolne" do not have the same auditory qualities; "bolne" and blowe" both contain a strong 'l' sound complimenting ***bl***_ossumez_, alliterating smoothly. The '**zh**' of bur**g**eon is harsher and less refined, for that Modern English lacks a suitable substitute!  

For Armitage, the 'sh' in _shimmer_ & _show_ merges smoother; shame it is while fantastical an inferior and irrelevant image. The Pearl Poet writes on the changing of the seasons in here a grounded manner; not fantastical. Nature's raw beauty is enough, and the Green Knight --a stand-in for Christian-shunned Paganism's Nature, witchcraft, and the base desires of man-- waits in winter to deal Gawain an ax-blow. All through the poem nature and natural forces frustrate Gawain's attempts at virtuousness, be it conveyed through hunting, sexual desire, or survival instincts.

- _Miniature 24r from Jacobi de Ancharano's_ Litigation of Christ with Belial, _1461._

<br>

In the poem, the passage of a whole year taking place in a single paragraph is contradistinguished with 6 prior describing the Green Knight's horse & clothing, and another ~6 of a supernatural event taking place. That the season then changes so rapidly that it passes in a near-instance, and that that the blossoms "bolne" and then "blowe" re-emphasizes the topic of the stanza: the literal process of the seasons changing, and, in context, time's quickness and life's fleetingness for a man trepadatious about fearsome circumstances anticipated a year after that supernatural event. In the original each aspect of meaning, poetry, and music are tightly interwoven.  
  
I really admire Armitage not because I think he succeeded in truly showing what made this sort so great, but because his is a braver endeavour; Tolkien's translation, paired with his peerless annotated edition of the original Middle English, is both good poetry and a useful tool; it is an academic's effort. Armitage is bold for that he is trying to capture the **feeling** of the poem for a modern audience over the meaning, an unrealistic aspiration when the goal is G&TGK.  

I don't think I could effectively modernise _Gawain_ either, but also I don't want to. Rather, I find it is better to persevere with annotations in pencil, or use [a tool like what I am making](https://github.com/goodpals/middle-english-mouse-dictionary) to quickly reference medieval English words, and meet the language on its own terms.
