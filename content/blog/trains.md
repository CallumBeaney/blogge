I was riding on an overground train in the UK, the automated announcements of which are offensively frequent and overloud. This has received much comment. The Johnson government announced [a review](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/unnecessary-train-announcements-binned-in-bonfire-of-the-banalities) into excessive announcements in 2022.  

9 years earlier Under-Secretary for Transport Norman Baker [commented](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-21773741) that:
> _Someone has designed a computer program somewhere in a dark cellar and they have put it into the train and [it] plays incessantly and no-one has the power, it seems, to stop the program playing._

The train approached its penultimate stop.  
The announcer said:  

- Welcome to this service for Shenfield.  
- We will be calling at Ingatestone, and Shenfield.  
- The next stop will be Ingatestone.  

The train then began to depart from Ingatestone.  
The announcer a minute later said:

- Welcome to this service for Shenfield.  
- We will be calling at Shenfield.  
- The next stop will be Shenfield.
