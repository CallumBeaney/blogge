Here is   
　my [visual site](https://callumbeaney.github.io/index.html).  
　my [Github profile](https://github.com/CallumBeaney).  
  
I make   
　software with [Goodpals](https://goodpals.dev), and  
　typefaces with [Mother](https://mother-type.de), and  
　articles with [C4 Journal](https://c4journal.com/about/).  

To contact me,  
　halve my forename,  
　prepend to my surname,

This site was built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/),
