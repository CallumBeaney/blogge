            <p>Below is one of my favourite parts of the Pearl Poet's <em>Gawain and the Green Knight</em>, a 14th-century poem written in a Cheshire dialect:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>After Crystenmasse com þe crabbed lentoun,

<h5 id="pronunciation">Pronunciation:</h5>
<ul>
<li>'ȝ' is 'gh' as in 'enough'</li>
<li>'þ' is 'th' as in 'the'</li>
<li>'y' is pronounced like 'i' in 'with'.</li>
</ul>
<!--  
##### Some notes here:
- __fraystez__ or 'fraist' is a test of strength or resolve, often in a form of physical attack. 
- __busken__ is like 'hasten' or 'busy oneself'.
- __bolne__ means 'swell' in much the same slightly medical manner we might now mean.
- __wlonk__ means "noble" in the sense of class or quality of behaviour, sometimes used to refer to the quality of a season or natural feature or location. 
  - The 15th century *Awntyrs off Arthure* contains the line "*To þe wode are thay wente, the wlonkeste in wedys, Bothe the kynge and the qwene.*" -- "the king and queen went to the woods in their finest clothes". Note 'wedez' (clothing) appears above also.    -->

<h3 id="here-s-some-basic-modernisation">Here's some basic modernisation:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>After Crystenmasse came the lonely lent season,<br />
Which tests the flesh with fish and food more simple;<br />
But then the weather of the world fights with winter,<br />
Cold clings down, clouds lift up,<br />
Brightly falls the rain in warmest showers,<br />
Falling upon fair fields, flowers there showing,<br />
Both the ground and the groves being green of clothes,<br />
Birds hasten to nest, and sing beautifully
For solace of the soft summer that follows thereafter<br />
by hillsides;<br />
And blossoms swell to blow<br />
By hedgerows rich and thick,<br />
And then glorious notes<br />
Are heard in woods so noble.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The simplified version is easier to grasp for a <em>modern</em> reader, but the economy of language, rhythm, and feeling of these words in the mouth &amp; ears is absent. The Pearl Poet was attentive to these qualities to such a degree that a synonym of a given word will regularly appear in the selfsame line, and the result is a maturity of composition that makes other great poems of the era such as <em>The Castle of Perseverance</em> sound almost amateur by comparison. </p>

<p>This kind of marginalia is unsuitable for screens. My whimsical side has a little parasocial friendship with Mr. David Woodward of St John's College, who, in addition to his dictionary annotations, made little drawings of a pipe-smoking moon in my copy of <em>Gawain</em>. Whenever I struggle with a page, I feel as though I have a friend reading along with me. I'm deeply upset that the book's spine glue is drying out.</p>

<h3 id="tolkien-s-modernisation">Tolkien's modernisation:</h3>
<p>Tolkien understood the Pearl Poet well; his translation is semantically faithful, and the glossary &amp; notes to the original with E.V. Gordon and Norman Davis are superlative in quality. His modernisation by necessity forces poetic English of the 1900s into the structure and logic of that of the 1300s:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>after Christmas there came the crabbed Lenten
</span><span>that with fish tries the flesh and with food more meager;
</span><span>but then the weather in the world makes war on the winter,
</span><span>cold creeps into the earth, clouds are uplifted, 
</span><span>shining rain is shed in showers that all warm
</span><span>fall on the fair turf, flowers there open,
</span><span>of grounds and of groves green is the raiment,
</span><span>birds are busy a-building and bravely are singing
</span><span>for the sweetness of the soft summer that will soon be on 510
</span><span>the way;
</span><span>and blossoms burgeon and blow
</span><span>in hedgerows bright and gay;
</span><span>then glorious musics go
</span><span>through the woods in proud array.
</span></code></pre>
<p>Tolkien is attentive to the original language and word order of the original, making occasional substitution to maintain a degree of old feeling. The rhythm and alliterative stresses differ significantly, particularly the 2nd line and also in the more contemporary, inappropriately sing-song '<em>birds are busy</em> <em><strong>a-building</strong></em> <em>and bravely are singing</em>'.</p>
<p>Modern English relies heavily word order; Middle English did not; so many of these sentences have their stresses shifted by stricter modern grammatical patterns that oblige being-verbs to appear in specific places.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bot þenne þe weder of þe worlde wyth wynter hit þrepez</em></li>
<li><em>But then the weather in the world makes war on the winter</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The original's 3rd line mixes 'th' and 'w' such that it alliterates on both across the line, using <strong>w</strong>y<strong>th</strong> to tie the two together after a bracketing beginning and ending full of 't' sounds (boT Thenne ; hiT Threpez).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Boþe groundez and þe greuez grene ar her wedez</em></li>
<li><em>Of grounds and of groves green is the raiment</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The original is bolstered with the plural form's 'ez' to further give the sentence consistency, to tie better <strong>wedez</strong> with <strong>grevez</strong>. <em>Greves</em> rhymes with <em>wedez</em> and <em>raiment</em> does not with <em>groves</em>. Line #5 ends with a 'w' in 'warme' and #7 with 'wedez'; lines #6 and #8 sibilant with 'schewen' &amp; 'syngen'. Tolkien cannot manage such subtlties while balancing aspects.</p>
<p>In these two examples I am purposefully terse; summarising in short: these insufficiencies originate not from Tolkien but his task.</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3 id="simon-armitage-s-modernisation">Simon Armitage's modernisation:</h3>
<p>Armitage borrowed Tolkien's heavily, but changed words and phrases too obscure. Armitage focuses on the feeling &amp; telling of the story, rather than on semantic faithfulness:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>after Christmas there came the sullen Lent
</span><span>that tests the flesh with fish and food more meager;
</span><span>but then the weather in the world makes war on the winter, 
</span><span>cold creeps back into the earth, clouds are uplifted, 
</span><span>shining rain is shed in showers that warm 
</span><span>and fall on the fair fields, where flowers open;
</span><span>on grounds and on groves, the earth&#39;s clothing is green, 
</span><span>birds are busy building and boldly are singing 
</span><span>for the sweetness of the soft summer that will soon be on  
</span><span>the way;
</span><span>and blossoms shimmer and show 
</span><span>in bushes bright as day;
</span><span>their colors like melodies flow
</span><span>through woods in grand display.
</span></code></pre>
<p>What I want to emphasise is that it was not only the story itself that made the Pearl Poet significant when re-discovered in the 19th century; it was the technical proficiency with which it was written specific to the language of the time.</p>
<p>The original was <em>blossumez bolne to blowe</em>. Tolkien chooses &quot;<em>blossoms burgeon and blow</em>&quot;. Burgeon is semantically closer, having also archaic meaning of &quot;to bud&quot; and a modern meaning of expanding rapidly (often regarding industry or business), but &quot;burgeon&quot; and &quot;bolne&quot; do not have the same auditory qualities; &quot;bolne&quot; and blowe&quot; both contain a strong 'l' sound, alliterating smoothly by being similar in sound. The 'zh' of burgeon sounds harsher and less refined a literary choice. For Armitage, the 'sh' in <em>shimmer</em> &amp; <em>show</em> merges smoother; shame it is an inferior image; more fantastical but less on-topic. </p>
<p>'Bolne' means 'swell'. Much of the native blossoming trees of that time, such as the bird cherry and crab apple, form in tight bursts of white and light-pink petals, that slowly build and then gradually disperse. That <em>bolne</em> emphasises something (usually) gradually growing from within -being used to reference things like pride, pus-filled boils and sexual excitement- isn't a casual choice.</p>
<p>The Pearl Poet writes on the changing of the seasons in here a grounded manner; not fantastical. In the poem, the passage of a whole year taking place in a single paragraph is contradistinguished with 6 prior describing the Green Knight's horse &amp; clothing, and another ~6 of a supernatural event taking place. That the season then changes so rapidly that it passes in a near-instance, and that that the blossoms &quot;bolne&quot; and then &quot;blowe&quot; re-emphasizes the topic of the stanza: the literal process of the seasons changing, and, in context, time's quickness and life's fleetingness for a man trepadatious about fearsome circumstances anticipated a year after that supernatural event. In the original each aspect of meaning, poetry, and music are tightly interwoven.</p>
<p>I don't think I could competently modernise <em>Gawain</em>, but also <strong>I don't want to</strong>. Rather, I find it is better to persevere with annotations in pencil, or use <a href="https://github.com/goodpals/middle-english-mouse-dictionary">a tool like what I made to quickly reference medieval English words</a>, and meet the language on its own terms.</p>
