is one of my favourite passages from the Pearl Poet's Gawain and the Green Knight, a 14th-century English poem written in a Cheshire dialect:\n\nPronunciation:\n\n'ȝ' is 'gh' as in 'enough' (if this displays improperly, imagine a '3').\n'þ' is 'th' as in 'the'\n'y' is pronounced like 'i' in 'with'.\n\n\n\nHere's some basic modernisation:\n\nAfter Crystenmasse came the lonely lent season,\nWhich tests the flesh with fish and food more simple;\nBut then the weather of the world fights with winter,\nCold clings down, clouds lift up,\nBrightly falls the rain in warmest showers,\nFalling upon fair fields, flowers there showing,\nBoth the ground and the groves being green of clothes,\nBirds hasten to nest, and sing beautifully\nFor solace of the soft summer that follows thereafter\nby hillsides;\nAnd blossoms swell to blow\nBy hedgerows rich and thick,\nAnd then glorious notes\nAre heard in woods so noble.\n\nThe simplified version is easier to grasp for a modern reader, but the economy of language, rhythm, and feeling of these words in the mouth &amp; ears is absent. The Pearl Poet was attentive to these qualities to such a degree that synonyms of a given word will regularly appear in the selfsame line. The result is a maturity of composition making other great poems of the era such as The Castle of Perseverance sound almost amateur by comparison.\n\nHere's margin notes appended:\n\nAfter Crystenmasse com þe crabbed lentoun, | cold/unsociable\nÞat fraystez flesch wyth þe fysche and fode more symple; | tests/challenges\nBot þenne þe weder of þe worlde wyth wynter hit þrepez, | contends\nColde clengez adoun, cloudez vplyften,\nSchyre schedez þe rayn in schowrez ful warme,  | bright/white\nFallez vpon fayre flat, flowrez þere schewen,  | fields\nBoþe groundez and þe greuez grene ar her wedez, | greaves, clothes\nBryddez busken to bylde, and bremlych syngen | birds hasten, gloriously\nFor solace of þe softe somer þat sues þerafter  | proceeds/follows\nbi bonk; | hillsides\nAnd blossumez bolne to blowe | swell\nBi rawez rych and ronk,  | hedgerows,  thick/luxuriant\nÞen notez noble innoȝe\nAr herde in wod so wlonk. | noble/beautiful\n\nThis kind of marginalia is unsuitable for screens. My whimsical side has a little parasocial friendship with Mr. David Woodward of St John's College, who, in addition to plentiful dictionary annotations, made little drawings of a pipe-smoking moon in my copy of Gawain. Whenever I struggle with a page, I feel as though I have a friend reading along with me.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nTolkien's modernisation:\nTolkien understood the Pearl Poet well - his translation is semantically faithful, and the glossary &amp; notes to the original with E.V. Gordon and Norman Davis are superlative in quality. His modernisation by necessity forces poetic English of the 1300s into the structure and logic of that of the 1900s:\n\nRhythm and alliterative stresses differ significantly, particularly the 2nd line and also in the more contemporary, inappropriately sing-song and affected 'birds are busy a-building and bravely are singing' (\"bravely\" is also a slightly slanted word choice but I shan't be a bully).\nHeavily on relies word order for natural sounding sentences Modern English; many of these sentences' stresses are shifted by stricter modern grammatical patterns obliging being-verbs to appear in specific places.\n\nBot þenne þe weder of þe worlde wyth wynter hit þrepez\nBut then the weather in the world makes war on the winter\n\nThe original's 3rd line mixes 'th' and 'w' such that it alliterates on both across the line, using wyth to tie the two together after a bracketing beginning and ending full of 't' sounds (boT Thenne ; hiT Threpez).\n\nBoþe groundez and þe greuez grene ar her wedez\nOf grounds and of groves green is the raiment\n\nThe original is bolstered with the plural form's 'ez' to further give the sentence consistency, to tie better wedez with grevez. Greves rhymes with wedez and raiment does not with groves. Line #5 ends with a 'w' in 'warme' and #7 with 'wedez'; lines #6 and #8 sibilant with 'schewen' &amp; 'syngen'. Tolkein doesn't catch any of this, and bar rhythm I do wonder why something more like Both the grounds and the groves, grene are their clothes was not chosen. But, I think these insufficiencies are partly Tolkien, and mostly his task.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\nSimon Armitage's modernisation:\nArmitage borrowed Tolkien's heavily, but changed words and phrases too obscure. Armitage focuses on the feeling &amp; telling of the story, rather than on semantic faithfulness:\n\n\nWhat I want to emphasise is that it was not only the story itself that made the Pearl Poet significant when re-discovered in the 19th century; it was the technical proficiency with which it was written using the language of the time.\n'Bolne' means 'swell', emphasising something gradually growing from within and usually used to reference things like pride, pus-filled boils and sexual excitement. The original was blossumez bolne to blowe. Tolkien chooses \"blossoms burgeon and blow\". Burgeon is semantically closer, having also archaic meaning of \"to bud\" and a modern meaning of expanding rapidly (often regarding industry or business), but \"burgeon\" and \"bolne\" do not have the same auditory qualities; \"bolne\" and blowe\" both contain a strong 'l' sound complimenting blossumez, alliterating smoothly. The 'zh' of burgeon is harsher and lacks the same smoothness, for that Modern English lacks a suitable substitute.\nFor Armitage, the 'sh' in shimmer &amp; show merges smoother - shame it is while fantastical an inferior image. The Pearl Poet writes on the changing of the seasons here in a grounded manner. In the poem, the passage of a whole year taking place in a single paragraph is contradistinguished with 6 prior describing the Green Knight's horse &amp; clothing, and another ~6 of a supernatural event taking place. The Green Knight --a stand-in for Christian-shunned Paganism's Nature, witchcraft, and the base desires of man-- waits in winter to deal Gawain an ax-blow. That the season then changes so rapidly that it passes in a near-instance, and that the blossoms are described at the beginning and end of their brief life cycle in \"bolne\" and then \"blowe\", for me, is not just a narrative fast-forward, but a small but subtle way to point to life's fleetingness, particularly for our man Gawain's trepadation for fearsome circumstances anticipated a year after that supernatural event. In the original each aspect of meaning, poetry, and music are tightly interwoven.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\nBoth translations are good, but neither reach the level of the Pearl Poet. I do admire Armitage not because I think every choice shows perfectly what made this story so great, but because his is a braver endeavour, and is more proper to being his own act of creation; Tolkien's translation, paired with his peerless annotated edition of the original Middle English, is both good poetry and a useful tool; it is an academic effort. Armitage is bold for that he is trying to capture the feeling of the poem for a modern audience over strictly the meaning; a real aspiration when the goal is G&amp;TGK.\nI don't think I could effectively modernise Gawain either, but also I don't want to. Rather, I find it is better to persevere with annotations in pencil, or use a tool like what I am making to quickly reference medieval English words, and meet the language on its own terms.\n\n","id":"/blogge/blog/gawain/","title":"Meeting languages on their own terms (Gawain & The Green Knight)"},"/blogge/blog/hackathon/":{"body":"\n\nI was invited to participate as a developer at Cambridge University Library's week-long Hackathon, where ~30 postgraduates made educational app prototypes, giving researchers of the Hidden In Plain Sight project ideas for educational software.\nINDEX\n　The week\n　The historical context\n　Imaging techniques &amp; materials analysis\n　Prototyping\n　Teamwork &amp; academia\n　Final thoughts\n　Recommended reading\n\nThe week\n\nMonday: Introductions, presentations &amp; demonstrations on heritage-oriented scientific imaging techniques, design thinking for app development, meeting curators, etc.\nTuesday: \"Speed dating\" for to form groups of 5, pitching project ideas, paper prototyping.\nWednesday: Prototyping all day, an update at the end of the day.\nThursday: Prototype app testing with brought-in testers who matched user personas, feedback meetings, more prototyping.\nFriday: Cleanup and presentation to university &amp; project members.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\nThe historical context\nThe Bible's first authorized English-language printing, The Great Bible (1539) was distributed to every English parish during the Reformation, for to legitimise Henry VIII's divorce from the Catholic church and self-imposition as the head of the local Church of England.\nThomas Cromwell (above) commissioned an illuminated variant for the king with his own portrait pasted over the figure to the king's right on the book's title page (below). That seam below his chin was discovered by illuminating the page with a raking light during microscope inspection.\nBoth versions are riddled with brazen heresy and propaganda, most comically the shunting of the word of the Lord to a narrow sliver above the enormous figure of the now-Godlike Henry VIII distributing these books to the populace below. You can read more about the illuminated copy's many political alterations here.\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nImaging techniques and materials analysis\nHaving worked in the past in heritage digitzation, I was familiar with the purely photographic stuff like photogrammetry, MSI, panoramic stitching tools etc. The newer materials-specific techniques introduced to us in the labs around the Cultural Heritage Imaging Laboratory in the library included e.g. Fibre-Optic Reflectance Spectrography (FORS), and X-Ray Flouresence Spectroscopy (XRF - below). \nEach technique has its own pitfalls: XRF isn't good with organics; some pigment identification processes are highly influenced by the pigment's substrate, and so on. Analysis of output data &amp; graphs is consequently, in the researchers' own words, highly interpretive.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nMacro-XRF Analysis of the Great Bible by Nathan Daly at the Hamilton Kerr Institute\n\nApplication of machine learning to these technologies has been discussed (1, 2), and surveys have identified that there is more general uptake of ML in a cultural heritage context (2020, 2022), but even in larger institutions this can be either highly localised to a specific project, be owing to financial or quality requirements slow to develop, or be otherwise tailored insufficiently.\nThe prototypes we made at the hackathon focused on public edification rather than on e.g. internal tools for researchers; I'd love to be involved in designing and building massive data &amp; training sets for specialised open source tooling.\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nThe MSI unit in the CUL Digital Lab.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nA 3D print of a Chinese oracle bone, digitised via photogrammetry\n\nPrototyping\nThe goal was to make an educational app providing extra insight into this book and/or the analysis methods used to study it. \nWith four software developers and around 25 students, four groups were formed. In past years app prototyping was done with a generic JS stack; the last two, the hosts moved to simulating a user experience by building UIs with basic conditional logic in Figma, owing to developers having to stay up late in previous years programming in the features, and due to their role in the collaborative process being both less integrated and less accessible to non-technical participants.\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nWorkflows from board to screen\nBy doing this however the scope of the app prototypes expanded and so this year also we developers stayed up late. This really was OK, but is humorously microcosmic of automation in industry.\nWith stylised history-themed mystery-puzzle games like Return of the Obrah Dinn and Pentiment in mind, teammates envisaged a \"find the clue\" investigation game in which the player - cosplaying as a researcher-out-of-time tasked by the King to find out why his special copy of the Bible is so suspicious - would inspect and 'colour in' the print version with the illuminated colour version by applying these research tools to it, in a click+paint manner. For the final product itself, TTS and adaptive animation tools like Facebook's Animated Drawings might be utilised.\nAchieving this with Figma being difficult, we opted for a simpler click here to see how it'd look button to trigger a fading painting-in-effect animation.\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nScreenshots from our Figma project.\nWithout a proper toolchain prototyping for a minigame like this involves \"telling\" over \"showing\" for the testers brought in; we imagined a GUI showing many different tools to use on the manuscript; we were advised to instead simulate the experience of one or two features, well. As such we hard-coded a fixed path, rather than the \"open map\" we wanted, where the user would zoom in &amp; out and inspect the pertinent elements of the title page in whatever order they desired.\nWhereas many project ideas take time to develop naturally, the basic shape of our project was already partly formed at the group-forming stage. Interested in a younger persona (a schoolkid) seeking an entertaining but edifying resource for a school report, our team began walking through how a user would experience the first stages of the game. We were quickly advised to slow down and take a step back; we tried, but despite reaching a roadblock on the 2nd day, we all shared roughly the same vision for the project.\n\nTeamwork and academia\nWorking with these academics was vitalizing. A couple of teammates were especially adept at prototyping &amp; making workflows/basic storyboards. Another was a natural manager. Others had great intution for concisely communicating (and cataloguing) relevant factual &amp; technical information.\nThough using Figma with only a little practice was a challenge, the most difficult thing was properly interacting with my fellow groupmates - as a developer I was also charged with helping to 'manage' the team a little, advising on ideas and keeping things on track so as to prevent scope creep. But really, I just wanted to follow every tangent. Also difficult was appropriately involving myself creatively; I was supposed to do so, but not too much, and I was at the start slightly too focused on this and not enough on those parts of my role.\n\n\nDone! The prototype is ready for tomorrow's presentation and you can be the first to see it. A big thank you to the team, it was amazing working with you on this prototype!Can you think of website like this for your research? pic.twitter.com/uMbTBYntU4— Martin Rocek (@Silencesys) June 20, 2024 \n\n\nOne of the developers, Martin Rocek, was experienced with Figma and previous Hackathons both, and kindly offered technical support to we other developers. His group's contribution was the most polished, and was for its more conservative design and refined architecture, likely the ideal reference choice for the Hidden In Plain Sight project. Martin has made a lot of interesting digital humanities things - have a look here.\nOther groups were more experimental in their presentation. Inspired by floral marginalia, R's group's UI was busy and digital-scrapbookish, with a stack-like architecture wherein the user would look closer, learning progressively finer detail of the book before gradually zooming back out.\nJ's group designed a linear progression of 3-column page layouts in which each main layout page had sub-pages or elements (like nodes) which could be interacted with before progressing onto the next main page. On each page the centre column contained article text, with comparison images either side. This more explorative and preference-driven user experience over a fixed path is suitable for museum tablets and displays.\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\nOutside of work, all we different groups met for breakfasts and dinners. All parties involved enjoyed a lovely meal on a green outside the host's residence on the Wednesday eve.\nMost of the time, being around other humans and being on my own feel to me very similar. People who bring the particular quality of having substantial knowledge interests, unabashed idiosyncracies, comfort prodding convential ideas and enthusiasm for new ones, are in the real world rare. All of these academics' areas of research were fascinating and the energy they carried in discussing them and sharing ideas with one another was a rare pleasure.\nYounger, less jaded researchers' casual discourse, free of the oily pretention of too many career academics and of the simplistic platitudes and moralities of daily life's conversants, allows for description-oriented discussion about and calm evaluation of  usually sensitive political and cultural topics, without the typical encumbering verbal asterisks, and it is missed.\nHere's a video walkthrough going over most of what we did:\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nThis prototype was a youth-oriented homework aid. For myself, I would rather than a game prefer to make a comprehensive visual comparison tool designed to use these two front pages as a single point of reference through which the entirety of the Reformation could be filtered to an engaged, even specialist audience - a sort of historiographical fulcrum.\nI feel somewhat conflicted about our contribution - the game idea was good and I would really like for my teammates to see it realised, however the final Hidden In Plain Sight app will be developed by a single member of the project team who has some webdev experience working in a developer-adjacent role. Given time/budget constraints typical to heritage sector projects, I don't expect building a game is feasible compared with less architecturally complex and asset-light prototypes. I could be and hope I am wrong.\nI encourage those reading this, be they developers or academics, to consider participating in this or like events.\n\nRecommended reading\n\nThe Fitzwilliam Museum Illuminated Manuscripts Lab\nHow Thomas Cromwell used cut and paste to insert himself into Henry VIII’s Great Bible - Ian McKee. \nA Material History of the Bible, England 1200 –1553, Eyal Poleg\nScience of the Book::Analytical Methods for the Study of Illuminated Manuscripts - Paola Ricciardi and Catherine Schmidt Patterson\nMartin Rocek's digital humanities tools \nHere's a short video of a previous iteration of this Hackathon.\nA prototype tool from a previous Hackathon for learning how to inspect medieval manuscripts.\n\n","id":"/blogge/blog/hackathon/","title":"Prototying at ＜HANDS: On＞ Cambridge University Hackathon"},"/blogge/blog/insecurity/":{"body":"In 2022 there was some legal furore over a collection of August Sander's photography being sold as NFTs, with the idea that they would be sold for little more than admin fees, under the below pretext:\n\nEach NFT represents ownership of the physical contact print made by Gerd Sander in 1988/89 and depicted by the image as well as access to the August Sander Research Database where the historical legacy of the Sander Family Estate will become publicly available for research.

Pegge footnotes it disyllabic: 'Rappy' like 'happy'.\nAfter having made a few ancient foods with due attention, I didn't make something historically faithful here. This is more about two nice things I made by following a recipe somewhat intentionally badly.\nI feebled around at first, e.g. when told to draw 'hem' through a strainer my reading comprehension failed and I chose to keep the fruits and not their juice, reducing the amount of liquid in the pulp then padding with rice flour. The result was a sticky, thick fruitcake much like a Christmas pudding, highly rich in flavour and heavy of texture, punctuated well by the light crunch of the fig seeds uncrushed. Best served this was with something like almond milk or double cream (right).\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nSpices I used cinnamon, galangal, sugar and crushed cloves. The pudding is even better if made with an equal third portion of dates.\nWhether or not they used red or white wine isn't certain, but given its historical prestige, most likely white; I prefer red. See Christopher Monk's article on a sort of precursor to Zabaione (among other things) for more.\nConsulting variations on this recipe and paying more attention to the English, it makes more sense that the liquid juices of these fruits were their primary interest - they coloured the result with the red of sandalwood for that the rice flour would pale the rich night-blood red of the fruits' juices. When heated, the sifted-in rice flour thickens rapidly (left).\nNow, I think what they did was use a relatively high mass:volume ratio - I put far too much fruit in here. Still, while figs are affordable I make both together regularly, keeping a fruitcake for the days after making the fruity porridge.  \n","id":"/blogge/blog/pudding/","title":"Making Rapé - a medieval porridge, and a pudding"},"/blogge/blog/pumpkinpie/":{"body":"This is my own recipe, made after deciding I disliked other ones. \nThe main adjustments are:\n\nThe pie: Using soft brown sugars for a more molasses-like flavour; Freshly steamed &amp; non-sweet pumpkin for a slightly earthier flavour. \nThe crust: Adopting a savoury shortcrust recipe into a sort of \"gingerbread shortcrust\"; Using wholegrain flours like Rye or Spelt to both get a nuttier flavour and a softer crust.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nIndex:\nMaking the puree\nPreparing the crust\nMaking the filling\nAdding a sugar topping\nStorage &amp; Finishing\nEquipment:\n\nWhisk, mixing bowl, baking paper, pie weights (or dry rice/lentils), fan oven, washing up gloves, blender, steaming pots.\n\nIngredient totals:\n\n200g flour, rye or spelt\n120g butter\n~270g soft brown sugar\n250g pumpkin puree\n250g double cream\n2 eggs\npowdered: cloves, ginger, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, white pepper.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\npumpkin puree\n\nDo not use frozen pre-prepared puree or canned pureee.

Here's an amusing advertisement of the Wang system that gets a jab in at Apple.\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe company had a team of 2-3 staff who would copy out handwritten documents with mechanical typewriters.\nTheir workflow was as follows:\n\nThe typists typed up the handwritten documents, and passed them to editorial.\nIn pencil the editors noted typos and further changes on the typed transcription, and returned them to the typists. \nThe typists reviewed these notes and corrected the errors by retyping the relevant pages.\nThe typists submitted the changed documents to editorial for review once more.\nRepeat stepts 2 - 4 until ready for publication.\n\nThese typists had no experience with computers and their then-novel textediting interfaces, nor had they undertaken any training. The result of the computer's sudden introduction into the office was that, when the second round of changes  were submitted to my friend the editor, he found these typo-corrected documents contained new errors in different places to the first round of corrections.\nThis scenario makes no sense unless you really imagine yourself without the understanding &amp; experience of computers necessary to know intuitively you don't need to type the whole printout back into the computer's word processor again in a new document for the second round of edits.\n\nRemembering who you're talking to in political disputes\nA good friend once told me that he learned to unwind his political angst in unproductive disagreements by reminding himself of who he was talking to and its relevance to the discussion; further that that reminding others of this context is useful, both in civil terms and as a criticism. So, when he found his opponent obstinate he would say, in perfect British form, something to the effect of: \"Given what I know of you and your life circumstances, it doesn't surprise me that you think the way you do\".\nI have found this enormously helpful and also hilarious in those moments when the want to be proven to be or to be seen as right feels too much like a need.\n\nPlaying video games for the first time\nRecently, I began introducing my wife to video games for effectively the first time in her life.\nIn the third area of Limbo (Playdead, 2010) is a basic physics puzzle wherein a noose hanging from a branch is weighed down by a corpse. The player needs to continue from the lower ground to its left, to the higher ground above &amp; to its right. The player character's weight, combined with the corpse's weight, bends the branch, pulling down the rope too low to make the swinging-jump from low to high. Beneath the rope and a little to its right, is a draggable bear trap:\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe solution is obvious: \n\nDrag the trap directly below the hanging corpse.\nJump onto the rope. The combined weight bend the branch, causing the corpse to enter the trap's mouth, releasing the corpse from the rope.\nThe branch will now raise high enough to let your character swing up to the higher ground.\n\nDespite my frustration watching the above not being done, the solution is only obvious if you have learned to mentally parse particular elements within a video game's scene as conceptually distinct from that scene's purely decorative elements in their capacity as objects with pre-programmed properties and interactions functioning as part of a discrete and rigid puzzle system of interactions between different such objects.\nNot knowing such a logic, being unfamiliar with WASD controls, and not just how limited the set of controllable behaviours the player character possesses are, what she speculated might be possible in the gameworld and therefore viable as a way to approach the problem, was unbounded. Things like: trying to climb up the edge of the cliff from its base; trying to enter the background and climb up the tree that way; climbing up nearby trees in the foreground to find a path through the tree branches, trying to drag large stones that were actually just part of the environmental foreground graphics.\n\nLooking at chords from funny angles\nOne of my strongest memories of school is when my guitar teacher took us from playing 12-bar-blues to some basic jazz. We sat down in the gym hall with a whiteboard, covered basic theory for how to build a fruity chord, and then played songs. I learned well then how interdependent theory and practice often are.\nWe were taught this voicing of a G6/9maj7 with some enthusiasm:\n\n\nWhat this teaching led to was enjoying experimenting with/absuing patterns &amp; structures more than learning &amp; playing set songs, often without respect for musicality, and this is probably why I failed to connect to other musicians until I discovered internet forums and also jazzcore.\nThis particular chord and its voicing are fun. With different voicings, that E might end up in the 2nd octave, at which point it's more justifiably nothing more than a major 13.\nThis kind of slightly flexible naming convention, pattern recognition led me to try breaking this chord up into two triads. Techically, if we treat the root as king, then it's a G6 on the bottom 3, and an A6sus on the top, but look, notes are notes and whatever you call it, what this contains is an Em/G in the lower 3 strings, and a Dmaj/A on the top strings:\n\nIn which case, you can almost logic your way into calling this an Em+D polychord. Whether we're convinced about the name doesn't much matter, because harmonically you can use it that way.\nPoint being: if you were to write a song composed of chords that can be neatly grouped into lower &amp; higher registers, and then within each bar, alternating between them to a consistent rhythm, would you be writing a song built of polychords, or, if composed right, a song in which you interleave two distinct chord progressions in two distinct keys?\n","id":"/blogge/blog/structures/","title":"Four anecdotes on paradigms & on perspective"},"/blogge/links/":{"body":"","id":"/blogge/links/","title":""},"/blogge/links/articles/":{"body":"I refuse to use a service more complicated than a Markdown file to host these.\nBlogs &amp;
